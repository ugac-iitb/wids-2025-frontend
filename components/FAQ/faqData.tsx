    quest: "How many projects can I apply for? Will I be able to update my choices after choosing the projects once?",
    ans: "You can select up to 5 projects as your preferences and must write a separate SOP for each of them. If you add more than 5 projects to your wishlist, only the top 5 will be considered. Once you've finalized your choices, go to the 'My Projects' page and click on 'Submit Preferences'.
